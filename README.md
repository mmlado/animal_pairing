## About Animal Pairing
Animal Pairing is a project created to make easier pairing up animals where genetic diversity is low. Registered users can enter data about their animals and ancestry and of animals they would like to pair them up. The Animal Pairing algorithm will determine the common ancestors and show it as percentage to the user for the purpose of selecting a pair with low or high score, depending on the desired traits of the offspring.
